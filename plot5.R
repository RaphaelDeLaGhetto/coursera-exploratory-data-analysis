# _How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?_
#

# This, of course, assumes that the ggplot2 package has already been installed
library('ggplot2')

# Unzip the dataset, if it hasn't already been unzipped

# the SCC.Level.One column and include all vehicles (e.g., planes, trains, boats, and automobiles. I.e.,
# anything with a motor).
