# Using the dataset provided, this script produces a plot that attempts to address the following question:
# 
# _Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?_
#

# This, of course, assumes that the ggplot2 package has already been installed
library('ggplot2')

# Unzip the dataset, if it hasn't already been unzipped 
if (!is.element('summarySCC_PM25.rds', dir()) | !is.element('summarySCC_PM25.rds', dir())) {

# Load the data, as suggested in the assignment description
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Get all the SCC codes that contain some combination of the words 'coal' and 'comb' (for 'combustion').
# It was determined, through trial and error, that the Short.Name, EI.Sector, and SCC.Level.Four columns
# meet the specified regex criteria.

# This inquiry concerns coal-fired emissions from across the United States for the four years for which data has been provided.
coalCombustion <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% sccCodes, ]

# This will help clarify the overall trend in emissions levels
# Note: the division by 1000 is to bring the trend in line with the expectation of 'kilotonage' in the barplot
